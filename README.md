## Requirements

## Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Centic bot network tool:

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:

   - Reconfigure the `.env` file according to your needs.

3. **Prepare necessary files**:

   - Save the private key of your EVM wallet in `privateKeys.txt` (format: 0x...).
   - Save the `apiKey` in `tokens.txt`. You can manually get the `apiKey` from the web (application => storage => apiKey) or the tool will automatically retrieve it using the private key.
   - Save proxies in `proxy.txt` in the format: `proxy: http://user:pass@ip:port`.

4. **Buff referrals**:

   - To buff referrals for the main account, run the following command:

     ```bash
     node autoRef
     ```

   - Detailed information of the created wallets will be saved in `wallets.json` (you should save this file). The `privateKeys.txt` file will automatically update with the private keys of the new wallets.

5. **Get wallet address**:

   - Run the following command to get the wallet address through the private key:

     ```bash
     node setup
     ```

   - The wallet address will be saved in `wallets.txt`.

6. **Run the tool**:

   - Run the main tool with the following command:

     ```bash
     node main
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can run the tool with proxy support:

     ```bash
     node main-proxy
     ```
